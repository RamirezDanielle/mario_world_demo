# mario_world_demo
This code is an HTML document with embedded CSS and JavaScript. It defines the structure and behavior of a simple webpage. In the CSS section, it sets the background of the webpage to an image of clouds and styles several elements. The "bottom" div is positioned at the bottom of the page, and there are rows of "brick" divs, each representing a brown brick. There's also a "mario" div containing an image of Mario, and the image's height is set to 100 pixels.

In the JavaScript section, it initializes a "mario" object with initial coordinates (x: 0, y: 0). It then adds an event listener to the document's keydown event. When arrow keys are pressed (left, right, up, or down), it updates Mario's position accordingly by modifying the "left" and "bottom" CSS properties of the "mario" element. This allows you to control Mario's position on the screen using the arrow keys, with each keypress moving him in a specific direction.
